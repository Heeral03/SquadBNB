# Project: Problem, Solution & Impact

---

## 1. Problem

### People Perform Better in Squads — But Reading Has None

Humans are more consistent, motivated, and productive inside aligned communities.

- Study groups outperform solo learners  
- Fitness improves with accountability partners  
- Builders ship faster in teams  

Community creates momentum.  
Accountability creates consistency.  
Shared incentives create commitment.

Yet reading — one of the world’s most common intellectual activities — happens almost entirely alone.

---

### Readers Are Alone in a Crowded World

2.3 billion people read daily, yet most do it in isolation.

They generate insights.  
They write thoughtful reviews.  
They recommend books that drive sales.

But those insights disappear into centralized platforms.

Knowledge is created.  
Platforms capture the value.  
Readers receive none of the upside.

Reading is globally popular — yet socially disconnected and economically unrewarded.

---

### Book Clubs Fail Structurally

Traditional book clubs attempt community — but lack infrastructure.

| Problem | Why It Fails |
|----------|--------------|
| Scheduling conflicts | Meetings are hard to coordinate |
| Commitment fades | Attendance drops quickly |
| No accountability | Members stop reading |
| No incentives | No reason to stay engaged |

Without economic alignment or structured engagement loops, most book clubs dissolve.

---

### No Incentive. No Accountability. No Ownership.

Modern reading lacks three core drivers of sustained behavior:

- **Accountability** – No structured commitment mechanism  
- **Incentives** – No financial upside for insight or participation  
- **Ownership** – No proof of progress or reputation  

Meanwhile, Web3 focused primarily on financial primitives, leaving cultural contributors behind.

2.3 billion readers + 900 million Telegram users represent one of the largest untapped coordination layers in Web3.

The opportunity is not to convince people to read.  
They already do.

The opportunity is to give them a reason to read together.

## 2. Solution

### Core Thesis

Reading should not be solitary.  
Reading should not be unrewarded.  
Reading should not be owned by extractive platforms.

SquadBNB transforms reading from a passive hobby into an active, community-owned economy.

## Habit Formation Through Incentives

### Mechanisms & Why They Work
